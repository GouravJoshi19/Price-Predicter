## Installation

To use this diamond price prediction model, follow these steps:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/GouravJoshi19/diamond-price-predicter.git

```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Data
The dataset used for training the model is includedin this directory. The diamonds.csv file contains information about various diamonds, including their features and corresponding prices.
## Model
The machine learning model is implemented using Python and leverages the scikit-learn libraries. The new diamond prediction.ipynb script trains the model on the provided dataset, and the trained model is saved as diamond.pkl. The Streamlit_app (app.py) uses this trained model to make predictions.
